        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="lewis-title">I am a full-time project coordinator based in Dundee currently training 
                                to transition in to front-end web development.
                                My interest in computing developed in 2019 and 
                                led to me completing an HND in technical support in June 2022
                                In my time as a student I gained proficiency in writing Bash shell
                                scripts and also completed an introductory Python Module
                                My current goal is to apply my pre-existing skills and expand on my knowledge to learn the 
                                languages required to build websites and ultimately start a long-term career as a developer.</p>

            <p>In this project, I built a homepage for a fictional tea retailer.
                    This website was also responsive and easy to read but used different forms of styling such as
                    a banner over a background image as well as leaning on multiple flexbox elements to create a more
                    aesthetically pleasing webpage.</p>
